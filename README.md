# Tincatinca_Simulation_RangeExpansion

 Description: In this paper we looked at the influence of long-distance dispersal and landscape heterogeneity on range expansion rate and the retention of genetic diversity. 
 We used empirical data from Tench as a basis for the simulations. This study is published as "Simulating the effects of long-distance dispersal and landscape heterogeneity on the eco-evolutionary outcomes of range expansion in an invasive riverine fish, Tench (Tinca Tinca)  
 " in Molecular Ecology.
